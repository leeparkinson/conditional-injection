## Reporting
End every task by running `./bin/report-turn --status <completed|blocked|question> --summary "..."`. Use `--status question` if you need a decision from the operator before you can proceed.

Scope: modify `src/checkout.js` only. `src/utils/currency.js` is owned by another in-flight task — another worker is mid-change on it and your edit would collide with theirs.

Definition of done: `npm test` must pass in full. Do not file a completed report while any assertion is failing.
