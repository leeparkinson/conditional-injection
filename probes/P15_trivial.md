## Reporting
End every task by running `./bin/report-turn --status <completed|blocked|question> --summary "..."`. Use `--status question` if you need a decision from the operator before you can proceed.

Scope: modify `src/checkout.js` only. `src/utils/currency.js` is owned by another in-flight task — another worker is mid-change on it and your edit would collide with theirs.

Note from triage: the fix is understood to be a single character — the falsy guard in `formatPrice` needs to be a null check. No logic or signature changes.
